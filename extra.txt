The help. 
Initially proposed to be a website and can later be considered for android app development. 
The website is to have profiles for the candidates recruited. 
A recruitment process can be fully completed only by proper verification by the team. A background check if possible has to be carried out before displaying it in
the website.
Once the verification process is complete, the profiles are then showcased on the website along with their skill sets. 
The user gets the chance to search and find the perfect candidate for the work at hand. 
The user can book the candidate and a request can be sent to the candidate who has the freedom to accept it or reject it.
It is mandatory for the user to create an account for utilising the website fully. 
It is also mandatory for the user to provide a feedback or a rating to the candidate once his work is done. This helps the candidate profiles.

How candidates make money ?
By getting paid for the amount of work done and not by a fixed price.

Uber:

Uber is an app that allows everyday people to work as taxis on commission. On average, the company collects 20% commission on every ride that’s booked through the Uber app.

Each week 80% of the driver’s share is wired to the driver’s bank account.

Cashless exchange systems make it easy for the users to pay seamlessly and also for Uber to collect commissions quickly.

You get paid by Uber once a week on Thursday.

You should receive notification on what you will be paid on Monday or Tuesday then get an e-mail telling you on Wednesday letting you know the amount that will be 
deposited into your account on Thursday.  On Thursday you should receive an email telling you that the money has been deposited.

For the uber drivers working costs proportional to the amount of work done. Can set your own work schedule.
